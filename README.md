# m4aclock
A cli tool that updates the purchase time of your m4a files

```
m4aclock - Update M4A files' purchase time to now
USAGE: m4aclock [-c] <m4a file list>
OPTIONS:
  -c		Remove purchaser information
```

## Why?
iTunes doesn't let you, and I couldn't find a simple tool that does.

## Can I use this for other stuff?
Here, it can also clear some purchaser information. For more features, feel free to fork it -- the HJM4AMetadata class can handle most metadata items you might want and can be easily extended to support more.
